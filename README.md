# AXSOS HTML Basics Assignments

This repository contains my HTML assignments completed during the **AXSOS Academy Full-Stack Development Course**.  
Each folder represents a separate assignment where I practiced HTML (and sometimes CSS) fundamentals.

## 📂 Contents
- **Portfolio/** → A personal portfolio page built with HTML & CSS.  
- **Registration-Form/** → A registration form using HTML form elements.  

## 🎯 Purpose
These assignments were part of the **Front-End Development training** at AXSOS Academy, where I learned:
- Structuring webpages with HTML.
- Styling pages with basic CSS.
- Organizing files into projects.

## 🚀 Next Steps
As I progress in the course, I will add more assignments and update this repository with additional front-end projects.
