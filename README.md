Project Title: Registration Form (HTML Forms Practice)

Description:
This assignment was part of the AXSOS Academy frontend training. The goal was to practice creating a registration form using only HTML, without any CSS or JavaScript. I learned how to use different input types, labels, and form structures.

Features Covered:

input type="text" for names and email

input type="password" for password fields

input type="date" for birthday

input type="radio" for gender identity

input type="checkbox" for email subscription

textarea for self-description

select dropdown for favorite language

input type="submit" for form submission

Learning Outcome:

Gained familiarity with basic HTML form tags.

Understood required fields (*), and how forms are structured before styling or backend integration.
